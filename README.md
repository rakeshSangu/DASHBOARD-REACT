# 🖥️ Dynamic Dashboard (React + Context API)

This project is a **React-based dynamic dashboard** built as part of an assignment.  
The dashboard is driven by a **JSON file** and allows users to **add, remove, search, and manage widgets** across multiple categories.  
All state changes are persisted locally using **localStorage**.
